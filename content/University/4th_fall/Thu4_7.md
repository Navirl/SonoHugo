It’s darker.
Night again.
We were at a camp untill just a few minute ago.
The needle is moving.
It also will come to a storm.
Shut up! That’s heard.
We are backpackers, you know?
It hopes to be killing us.
Nobody comes. That’s illusion.
Do you hope to death?

It’s getting dark again.
It’ll soon be night.
We only left camp only a few hours ago.
The hands are moving.
Another storm’s coming.
Enough! I’m sick of listening to you.
We’re mountain men.
It’s waiting for us to die!
It for to
No one’s coming! It’s an illusion.
If you do you’ll die!
